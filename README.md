Data shows that the peak hours of use were after working hours, between 17:00-19:00. The third largest was in the 08:00 hour, before work starts. People are using before and after work hours.

![Check Out Times for Users](Check_Out_Times_For_Users.PNG)

Our analysis show that when a user checks out a bike, on avarage they are only using it for 10 minutes. There is a sharp decline from there, with a very small number keeping the bike for an hour and almost no one keeps the bike for two hours or more.

![Gender Breakdown](Gender_Breakdown.PNG)

A majority of the users are male. About a quarter of the users are female.

![Checkout Times by Gender](Checkout_Times_by_Gender.PNG)

We broke up the check out time by gender. Results were similar. Most of the users are returning the bike within the first hour (most within 30 minutes) and no gender keeps the bike two hours or more.

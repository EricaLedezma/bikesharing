## Results
Analysis was performed on data from NYC bike trip data from the month of August 2019. Here are the results:

![August Peak Hours](August_Peak_Hours.PNG)

Data shows that the peak hours of use were after working hours, between 17:00-19:00. The third largest was in the 08:00 hour, before work starts. People are using before and after work hours.

![Check Out Times for Users](Check_Out_Times_For_Users.PNG)

Our analysis show that when a user checks out a bike, on avarage they are only using it for 10 minutes. There is a sharp decline from there, with a very small number keeping the bike for an hour and almost no one keeps the bike for two hours or more.

![Gender Breakdown](Gender_Breakdown.PNG)

A majority of the users are male. About a quarter of the users are female.

We broke up the check out time by gender. Results were similar. Most of the users are returning the bike within the first hour (most within 30 minutes) and no gender keeps the bike two hours or more. 

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour.PNG)

This heatmap shows the trips by weekday per hour. The darker the spot the more trips. This graph shows during the workweek the peak hours are between 07:00-09:00 and 16:00-19:00. This corresponds with our analysis that users are checking out the bikes before and after work. We see the reverse on the weekends, peak hours are between 10:00-18:00. 

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](Trips_by_Gender_Weekday_per_hour.PNG)

We broke down the heatmap above by gender. We see similar results. However, we see larger results with the male than the other genders.

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday.PNG)

This graph shows user trips broken down by weekday and by gender. Most of the users are subscribers and the trend follows here. The busier days are the weekdays: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 
For the customers, they tend to use the bikes during the weekends. The busier days are Saturday and Sunday and the data is equal for all genders.
